A socket is a connection between two hosts. It can perform seven basic operations:

• Connect to a remote machine | server & client

• Send data  | server & client

• Receive data| server & client

• Close a connection| server & client

• Bind to a port|server

. Listen for incoming data|server

• Accept connections from remote machines on the bound port|server

 Java programs normally use client sockets in the following fashion:
 
• The program creates a new socket with a constructor.

• The socket attempts to connect to the remote host.
